# Elaboration of the Examples

This page will try to elaborate on the example code contained in the examples
folder. The examples should already be commented some and the individual
functions should be fully documented. However, it is still useful to explain
what the sections in the example code are attempting to do.

> ***Note:** The autosim example requires one more external library to be run.
  See ["Setting Up Your Environment"](../Setup.md#setting-up-your-environment)
  for more information.*

Below is a link to documentation for each of the examples:
